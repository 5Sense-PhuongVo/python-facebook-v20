Sorry that I have limited contribution so far due to conflicting agenda and the best step for me now is to formally step down from the DevC Lead of HK. If anyone is interested in  DevC program, you can take a look at here. https://developers.facebook.com/developercircles/  Not to name everyone but I appreciate lots of people working in fb / other dev c leads who supported me along, and it is always exciting to meet passionate developers around the world. Big shout out to everyone in the community who make some of our events possible!","created_time":"2021-01-13T05:09:48+0000","updated_time":"2021-01-15T03:01:15+0000"},{"id":"2260975870792283_2846727322217132","message":"#DevFest this sun online!","created_time":"2020-10-13T13:45:57+0000","updated_time":"2020-10-13T13:45:57+0000"},{"id":"2260975870792283_2836539563235908","message":"Want to learn what it takes to build and manage a #super #app?

What does all of that mean? In a sense, this new information helps Git find points in history that touched a given path much more quickly (for example, git log -- , or git blame). Git 2.28 takes advantage of these optimizations to deliver a handful of sizeable performance improvements.","created_time":"2020-07-29T05:52:07+0000","updated_time":"2020-07-29T05:52:07+0000"}],"paging":{"previous":"https://graph.facebook.com/v10.0/2260975870792283/feed?access_token=access_token&pretty=0&fields=id%2Cmessage%2Ccreated_time%2Cupdated_time&until&__previous=1&since=1610679675&__paging_token=__paging_token"}}
