    "description": "Today Hindus everywhere celebrated Holi, an annual festival of colors held at the end of winter. In temples, the faithful prayed as colored powder and jets of colored water were sprayed upon them. Thousands of white-clothed revelers in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Nepal took to the streets to throw bright powders and perfumes at each other, and many captured the celebrations on Instagram.
